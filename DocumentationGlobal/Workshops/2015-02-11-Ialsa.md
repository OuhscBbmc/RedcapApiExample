REDCap
=================================================

### Inside Sweet spot
If your needs fit its sweet spot, life is good.  You'll get:

* Fast GUI development.
* Almost automatic security & logging to support HIPAA compliance.  This includes backup mechanisms and audit logs.
* Leverage existing (and possibly confederated) LDAP authentication.
* Various data entry options for public & private  visibility.
* One "server" that can host hundreds of "projects" (ie, databases).  Each has granular user privileges to isolate users' access between (and even within) projects.

To be in the sweet spot:

* The one-to-many relationships must all connect to the subject.  For IALSA contributors, I imagine the relationships will usally ebased on time.  REDCap's longitudinal capabilities work well when your protocol resembles a clinical research protocol.
* Either real-time data entry, or offline/disconnected entry that won't collide with other user's simultaneous writing.


### Outside Sweet spot
REDCap probably isn't the best tool for:

* Complex schemas with either (a) multiple nested one-to-many relationships, or (b) a lot of one-to-many relationships.
* Data warehouses, where it interacts only with computers.  If a human isn't either reading or writing to the database, probably better tools.
* Unconventional measurements & items.  It's not meant for cognitive items like eye tracking or sub-second reaction times.
* Datasets with a lot of churn.  If you're consistently deleting huge batches and rewriting, the log gets huge.

### Other Topics
* Conventional forms vs "Surveys"

* No such thing as a 'context-free' variable
