# Motivation
This is a running list of tips and advice creating a REDCap project.  Many of these are guided by the following principles:

* Encourage users to enter the cleanest & most accurate data so that the downstream analyses will be the most useful.  Make it easy for them to do the right thing.
* Reduce the time & expense of maintaining a REDCap project over several years.
* If there is dirty data is entered, make is easy to detect later.  We want to avoid silent errors.
* Picking a pattern that's easy to apply to as many projects as possible.  If two conventions are equally good, pick one so that it's easy for members of the research team to contribute to multiple projects.

# Tips
Here's is our advice.  Within each category, they're listed in roughly descending order of importance.

### Keys and IDs
1. For `studyid`, use an auto-incrementing variable.  This variable is super important in later data manipulation, that we need it to be as clean as possible.  If you need a [natural key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key) (ie, not a [synthetic/surrogate/artificial key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key)), create a second variable to contain it.  {Added by Thomas & Will, 2015-10.}
1. For `studyid`, allow only positive & negative integers.  Use validation to prevent strings and floating-point numbers.  Negative numbers are useful for temporary/test subjects.  If you prevent them, the users are likely to use a positive integer that's harder to identify & evict later.  {Added by Thomas & Will, 2015-10.}
1. For `studyid`, use validation to prevent any integer above 2^31-1 (=2,147,483,647).  Otherwise, downstream programs (eg, R & SAS) might convert this to a floating-point variable, and you'll be unable to distinguish between values like `91234567890123452` and `91234567890123453` since they're both represented as `91234567890123456` floats.  (Notice the last decimal is lost.)

    As Thomas notes, this shouldn't be a problem if you're using an auto-incrementing integer for `studyid`.  As of 2014, every living Chinese citizen will still fit under 2^31.

    If it's too late and this has already happenned, 
    * Convert the REDCap variable to a character/string variable.
    * Fix the diluted values in REDCap.
    * Make sure the stats programs treat it as a character variable, instead of automatically converting it to a float or integer.

### Outcome Variables
1. Validate and be as stingy as possible with every variable.  Where possible:
    * Use radio buttons for categorical variables.
    * Use validation to force dates/integers/numbers .
    * Use min & max values.
    * Avoid allowing null/empty values, because they're hard to account for in stat programs.  If a value is legitimately missing (eg, consider capturing that explicitly with a secondary variable).

1. Variable names have fewer options than usual, because capital letters aren't allowed.  Analysis is easier if the variable names don't have to change.  Therefore, think how you'll later use them in R or Python.  
    * Pick a style guide.  For R, the current trend is towards [Hadley's](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html) and [Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) conventions, and conveniently this works well with REDCap's prohibition of capital letters. {Added by Will, 2015-10.}
    * REDCap's wide format frequently has to be normalized (ie, converted from wide to tall).  This frequently requires regexes, so consider which names are most conveniently handled by a regex.  For example the collection (`iq_initial_age_2` ... `iq_year_5_age_12`) is less desirable than (`iq_year_0_age_02`...`iq_year_5_age_12`).  "Initial" has to be converted to a number, and because `age_2` isn't padded to `age_02`, you might have to brush up on greedy, lazy, and possessive regex matches. {Added by Will, 2015-10.}


### Reports, Media, Surveys, Whatever
{Create a category and add bullets when you think of some.}

### API
1. Use a library like [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR), [PhpCap](https://github.com/aarenson/PhpCap), or any of the others listed on [this page](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR). {Added by Will, 2015-10.}
1. Following the existing [Troubleshooting Guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapR/vignettes/TroubleshootingApiCalls.html). {Added by Will, 2015-10.}
1. Store tokens on an [LDAP-managed database](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapR/vignettes/SecurityDatabase.html). {Added by Will, 2015-10.}
1. Use the [following patterns](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/RedcapExamplesAndPatterns/tree/master/documentation_patterns). {Added by Will, 2015-10.}

### Validation
{I'm going to let our validation mechanism mature more before writing about it.}
